# O2TutorialOct22

This repo contains the result .cxx, .json (and .sh) files from the first O2Hands-On session here: 
https://indi.to/h6XQj

It is a nice collection of scripts to see how the analysis pipeline(s) can be:
  1) configured with .json files 
  2) executed through .sh files
  
Once I completed the secret levels the final results will be added !
